<h1>The Health Impacts and Mortality Risk of Air Pollution</h1>
<h2>Research Overview</h2>
<p align="justify">This study aims to comprehensively analyze air quality data from various countries and assess the associated mortality rates and disease burden caused by air pollution. Using modeling techniques such as interactive visualizations, we will present the spatial distribution of pollutants, including PM25, PM10, and NO2, and their ambient concentrations across different countries. By quantifying the burden of disease and mortality rates associated with air pollution, we will identify the impact of these pollutants on human health. Moreover, given the variable concentrations of these pollutants across the globe, we will analyze the different levels of air pollution in each country to better understand the variations in air quality and its associated health risks. The outcomes of this study will provide valuable insights into the global health impact of air pollution and contribute to the development of policies and interventions aimed at mitigating its harmful effects.<p>

<h3>Scope:</h3>
<p align="justify">The study covers a period of 5 years (2015-2019) and includes data on air quality, mortality rates, and disease burden associated with air pollution from a variety of countries. The focus is on the health impacts and mortality risk associated with exposure to ambient household air pollution, ambient particulate matter pollution, ambient ozone pollution, and air pollution caused by solid fuels.</p>

<h3>Research Questions</h3>
<ol align="justify">
<li><b>Ambient Air Quality Data</b></li>
The analysis focuses on the air quality levels, specifically PM25, PM10, and NO2, in the top 10 countries.

<li><b>AQ Pollution Mortality Data</b></li>
The analysis compares the causes of death due to different types of pollution with the impact of air pollution.

<li><b>Outdoor Pollution Rates by Ages</b></li>
The analysis focuses on the top 10 countries where air pollution is a leading cause of death across different age groups, with the aim of determining whether it disproportionately affects either the young or the old.

<li><b>Disease burden by Risk Factor</b></li>
The analysis involves comparing the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) attributed to various diseases .

<li><b>Number of death by Risk factors</b></li>
The analysis compares the causes of death due to various diseases with the impact of air pollution in the top 10 countries.

<li><b>Death Rates from Air pollution</b></li>
The analysis examines the top 10 countries where air pollution is a major cause of death, categorized by the type of air pollution, such as household pollutants or ozone.

Scope:





Limitations:


The study is limited by the availability and quality of data, which may vary by country and over time. In addition, the study focuses on selected types of air pollution and does not cover all possible sources of air pollution, such as industrial emissions or transportation-related pollution.



Overview:


The study involves analyzing air quality data from different countries as well as mortality rate and disease burden data related to air pollution. We used modeling technique like interactive vivisualizations to present the spatial distribution of pollutants such as PM25, PM10, and NO2 their ambient concentrations across different countries, quantifying air pollution,burden of disease and mortality rates. These pollutants, in addition to other pollutants vary across the globe and may result in different concentrations of air pollution  country to country.


Conclusions:

Pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 allow scientists to estimate the spatial distribution of their ambient concentrations across different countries, quantifying air pollution,burden of disease and mortality rates. These pollutants, in addition to other pollutants vary across the globe and may result in different concentrations of air pollution from city to city, and country to country.

Based on our analysis, it can be concluded that air pollution is among the top five factors contributing to mortality rates and burden of disease worldwide.

It can be deduced that similar age groups (i.e., under 5, 5-14, 15-49, 50-69, 70 plus) are affected similarly by air pollution in all countries across the globe.

Understanding the severity of air pollution and the burden of disease and mortality rates related to it is important for public health officials, policymakers, and healthcare providers, as it can help them to prioritize resources and develop interventions to reduce the impact of the disease on the population.
